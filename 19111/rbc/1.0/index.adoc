=== Description

RBC 1.0 is an XML Schema implementation derived from ISO ISO 19111, Geographic
information -- Spatial referencing by coordinates. It includes iSO 19111:2007 defines
the conceptual schema for the description of spatial referencing by coordinates,
optionally extended to spatio-temporal referencing. It describes the minimum data
required to define one-, two- and three-dimensional spatial coordinate reference
systems with an extension to merged spatial-temporal reference systems. It allows
additional descriptive information to be provided. It also describes the information
required to change coordinates from one coordinate reference system to another. The XML
schema was encoded using the rules described in ISO/TS 19139:2007, Clause 8 and
implementation approach from ISO/TS 19115-3, Clause 8.

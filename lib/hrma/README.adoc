= HRMA Library Documentation

== Overview

The HRMA (Harmonized Resources Maintenance Agency) library provides tools for managing ISO/TC 211 schemas and generating documentation. This document describes the internal structure and components of the library.

== Directory Structure

* `lib/hrma/` - Root directory for the HRMA library
** `build/` - Documentation generation components
** `commands/` - Command implementations for the CLI
** `cli.rb` - Main CLI class
** `config.rb` - Configuration management
** `version.rb` - Version information

== Key Components

=== Build System

The build system is responsible for generating documentation from schema files:

* `build/document_generator.rb` - Main class for generating documentation
* `build/schema_processor.rb` - Processes individual schema files
* `build/schema_work.rb` - Work item representation for parallel processing
* `build/schema_worker.rb` - Worker implementation for parallel processing
* `build/tools.rb` - Handles downloading and setting up external tools
* `build/cleaner.rb` - Handles cleaning generated files

=== Parallel Processing

The library uses Ruby's Ractor feature for parallel processing of schema files:

* Work is distributed across multiple Ractors using the Fractor framework
* Each schema file is processed in its own Ractor
* Results are collected and aggregated
* The number of Ractors is configurable or auto-detected based on system resources

=== Commands

The command system provides the CLI interface:

* `commands/build.rb` - Commands for building documentation
* `commands/schemas.rb` - Commands for managing schemas
* `commands/config.rb` - Commands for managing configuration

=== Configuration

Configuration is managed through:

* Command-line options
* Environment variables
* Configuration file (`~/.hrma/config.yml`)

== Development

=== Adding New Features

When adding new features:

1. Identify the appropriate component to modify
2. Update tests to cover the new functionality
3. Update documentation (including this README)
4. Update the main README.adoc if the feature affects user-facing functionality

=== Parallel Processing

The parallel processing system uses the Fractor framework to distribute work across multiple Ractors:

1. `SchemaWork` objects represent individual schema files to process
2. `SchemaWorker` processes each work item in a separate Ractor
3. `DocumentGenerator` coordinates the workers and collects results

When modifying the parallel processing system:

* Ensure all objects passed between Ractors are shareable
* Handle errors appropriately to prevent worker crashes
* Consider the impact on memory usage and system resources

== Introduction

This is the official repository of ISO/TC 211 XML Schemas.

Jointly managed by ISO/TC 211/XMG and Ribose.


== XSD documentation pages

XSD documentation pages are generated using the `build` workflow.

The `schemas.yml` file controls which schemas (identified by path)
should generate XSD documentation. It can be maintained manually or using the `hrma` command-line tool (see <<Schema manifest management>>).

The resulting documentation per schema will be generated in the path:

* HTML page: `_site/{schema-path}/{xsd-name}/index.html`
* Diagrams: `_site/{schema-path}/{xsd-name}/diagrams/*.svg`


== Schema manifest management

The repository includes a command-line tool called `hrma` (Harmonized Resources Maintenance Agency) to manage the schemas manifest file (`schemas.yml`). This tool allows for automatic discovery and registration of schema files.

=== Requirements

* Ruby (2.5 or later)
* Dependencies installation (choose one):
  - Individual: `gem install thor`
  - Using Bundler: `bundle install`
  - Build and install gem: `gem build hrma.gemspec && gem install hrma-*.gem`

=== Usage

[source,sh]
----
# Update schemas.yml with all 3-character XSD and JSON files
./bin/hrma schemas manifest update

# List all schemas in the manifest file
./bin/hrma schemas manifest list

# List schemas with filtering options
./bin/hrma schemas manifest list --type xsd
./bin/hrma schemas manifest list --doc 19115

# Verify all schemas in the manifest exist
./bin/hrma schemas manifest validate
----

The tool supports both XSD and JSON schemas and organizes them in the schemas.yml file according to their type.

== Building documentation

[source,sh]
----
# removes generated artifacts
make clean

# makes _site
make all

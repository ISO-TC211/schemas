== Introduction

This is the official repository of ISO/TC 211 Schemas, jointly managed by
ISO/TC 211/XMG and Ribose.

== Requirements

* Dependencies installation (choose one):
  - Individual: `gem install thor rake`
  - Using Bundler: `bundle install`
  - Build and install gem: `gem build hrma.gemspec && gem install hrma-*.gem`
* External dependencies:
  - Java (for generating diagrams)
  - xsltproc (for generating documentation)


== Command-line reference

=== General

The repository includes a command-line tool called `hrma` (Harmonized Resources
Maintenance Agency) to manage schemas and generate documentation.


=== Schema management

The `schemas` command manages the schema manifest file (`schemas.yml`), which
controls which schemas should generate documentation.

[source,sh]
----
./bin/hrma schemas manifest SUBCOMMAND
----

Available subcommands:

* `update` - Update schemas.yml with all 3-character XSD and JSON files
* `list` - List all schemas in the manifest file
** `--type TYPE` - Filter by schema type (xsd or json)
** `--doc DOC` - Filter by document number
* `validate` - Verify all schemas in the manifest exist

[example]
====
[source,sh]
----
# Update schemas.yml with all 3-character XSD and JSON files
./bin/hrma schemas manifest update

# List all schemas in the manifest file
./bin/hrma schemas manifest list

# List only XSD schemas
./bin/hrma schemas manifest list --type xsd

# List schemas for document 19115
./bin/hrma schemas manifest list --doc 19115

# Verify all schemas in the manifest exist
./bin/hrma schemas manifest validate
----
====

=== Documentation generation

The `build` command generates documentation for schemas defined in the manifest file.

[source,sh]
----
./bin/hrma build SUBCOMMAND [OPTIONS]
----

Available subcommands:

* `documentation` - Generate documentation for schemas
** `--manifest-path PATH` - Path to schemas.yml manifest file
** `--cache-dir DIR` - Directory for caching downloaded tools
** `--log-dir DIR` - Directory for storing log files
** `--parallel` / `--no-parallel` - Enable/disable parallel processing with Ractors
** `--ractors NUM` - Number of parallel ractors to use (default: auto-configured)
* `clean` - Remove generated documentation
* `distclean` - Remove generated documentation and downloaded tools
** `--global-cache` - Also clean the global cache directory

Examples:

[source,sh]
----
# Generate documentation for schemas
./bin/hrma build documentation

# Generate documentation with custom manifest file
./bin/hrma build documentation --manifest-path=custom-schemas.yml

# Generate documentation with 4 ractors
./bin/hrma build documentation --ractors=4

# Generate documentation without parallel processing
./bin/hrma build documentation --no-parallel

# Remove generated documentation
./bin/hrma build clean

# Remove generated documentation and downloaded tools
./bin/hrma build distclean
----

The resulting documentation per schema will be generated in the path:

* HTML page: `_site/{schema-path}/{xsd-name}/index.html`
* Diagrams: `_site/{schema-path}/{xsd-name}/diagrams/*.svg`

=== Configuration management

The `config` command manages configuration settings.

[source,sh]
----
./bin/hrma config SUBCOMMAND
----

Available subcommands:

* `get KEY` - Get a configuration value
* `set KEY VALUE` - Set a configuration value

Supported configuration keys:

* `cache_dir` - Directory for caching downloaded tools (default: `~/.hrma/cache`)
* `log_dir` - Directory for storing log files (default: `~/.hrma/logs`)

You can set configuration in three ways (in order of precedence):

. Command-line option: `--cache-dir=/path/to/cache`
. Environment variable: `HRMA_CACHE_DIR=/path/to/cache ./bin/hrma ...`
. Configuration file: `~/.hrma/config.yml`

Examples:

[source,sh]
----
# Get current cache directory
./bin/hrma config get cache_dir

# Set cache directory
./bin/hrma config set cache_dir /path/to/cache
----


== Advanced features

=== Parallel processing

The tool supports parallel processing using Ruby's Ractor feature. This
significantly speeds up documentation generation for large numbers of schema
files.

By default, the tool automatically determines the optimal number of ractors to
use based on your system resources:

* In "auto" mode (default), the number of ractors is determined by:
** Using half of your CPU cores (rounded down)
** Ensuring at least 2 cores are left free for system processes
** Using at least 1 ractor
** Using one ractor per file when possible (up to the calculated maximum)

This auto-configuration provides a good balance between performance and system
responsiveness.

[example]
====
* With 4 files on a 4-core system: 1 ractor would be used (half cores = 2, but ensuring 2 cores are free = 1)
* With 4 files on an 8-core system: 4 ractors would be used (half cores = 4, which leaves enough free cores)
* With 4 files on a 16-core system: 4 ractors would be used (one per file, even though 8 ractors would be available)
* With 10 files on a 16-core system: 8 ractors would be used (half cores = 8, which is less than file count)
====

You can manually specify the number of ractors:

[source,sh]
----
# Use 4 ractors for parallel processing
./bin/hrma build documentation --ractors=4
----

To disable parallel processing entirely:

[source,sh]
----
# Disable parallel processing
./bin/hrma build documentation --no-parallel

# Alternative method
HRMA_DISABLE_RACTORS=1 ./bin/hrma build documentation
----


== Code organization

The `hrma` tool is organized into several components:

=== Command-line interface

* `bin/hrma` - Main executable script
* `lib/hrma/cli.rb` - Thor-based CLI implementation
* `lib/hrma/commands/*.rb` - Individual command implementations

=== Build system

* `lib/hrma/build/document_generator.rb` - Main class for generating documentation
* `lib/hrma/build/ractor_document_processor.rb` - Processor for XSD files that can run within a Ractor
* `lib/hrma/build/documentation.rb` - Module with documentation generation utilities
* `lib/hrma/build/tools.rb` - Handles downloading and setting up external tools
* `lib/hrma/build/cleaner.rb` - Handles cleaning generated files

=== Configuration

* `lib/hrma/config.rb` - Configuration management
* `lib/hrma/version.rb` - Version information

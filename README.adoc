== Introduction

This is the official repository of ISO/TC 211 XML Schemas.

Jointly managed by ISO/TC 211/XMG and Ribose.


== XSD documentation pages

XSD documentation pages are generated using the `build` workflow.

The `schemas.yml` file controls which schemas (identified by path)
should generate XSD documentation. It can be maintained manually or using the `hrma` command-line tool (see <<Schema manifest management>>).

The resulting documentation per schema will be generated in the path:

* HTML page: `_site/{schema-path}/{xsd-name}/index.html`
* Diagrams: `_site/{schema-path}/{xsd-name}/diagrams/*.svg`


== Schema manifest management

The repository includes a command-line tool called `hrma` (Harmonized Resources Maintenance Agency) to manage the schemas manifest file (`schemas.yml`) and build documentation. This tool allows for automatic discovery and registration of schema files and generation of documentation.

=== Requirements

* Ruby (2.5 or later)
* Dependencies installation (choose one):
  - Individual: `gem install thor rake`
  - Using Bundler: `bundle install`
  - Build and install gem: `gem build hrma.gemspec && gem install hrma-*.gem`
* External dependencies:
  - Java (for generating diagrams)
  - xsltproc (for generating documentation)

=== Usage

[source,sh]
----
# Update schemas.yml with all 3-character XSD and JSON files
./bin/hrma schemas manifest update

# List all schemas in the manifest file
./bin/hrma schemas manifest list

# List schemas with filtering options
./bin/hrma schemas manifest list --type xsd
./bin/hrma schemas manifest list --doc 19115

# Verify all schemas in the manifest exist
./bin/hrma schemas manifest validate
----

The tool supports both XSD and JSON schemas and organizes them in the schemas.yml file according to their type.

== Building documentation

[source,sh]
----
# Generate documentation for schemas
./bin/hrma build documentation

# Generate documentation with custom cache directory
./bin/hrma build documentation --cache-dir=/path/to/cache

# Remove generated documentation
./bin/hrma build clean

# Remove generated documentation and downloaded tools
./bin/hrma build distclean

# Remove generated documentation and global cache
./bin/hrma build distclean --global-cache
----

== Configuration

The `hrma` tool can be configured in several ways:

=== Cache Directory

The cache directory is where downloaded tools are stored. By default, it's `~/.hrma/cache`.

You can set it in three ways (in order of precedence):

1. Command-line option: `--cache-dir=/path/to/cache`
2. Environment variable: `HRMA_CACHE_DIR=/path/to/cache ./bin/hrma ...`
3. Configuration file: `~/.hrma/config.yml`

To manage configuration:

[source,sh]
----
# Get current cache directory
./bin/hrma config get cache_dir

# Set cache directory
./bin/hrma config set cache_dir /path/to/cache
----
